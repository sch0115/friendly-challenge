      "taskTitle": "Implement Group Creation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the group creation feature into backend schema design, API implementation, Firestore integration, frontend form UI, input validation, and user feedback/error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both backend (schema, API, database) and frontend (form, validation, feedback) work, requiring coordination and careful validation. The need to update related user data and handle errors adds to the complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Activity Definition",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the activity definition feature into schema design, backend module/service, API endpoint, authorization, frontend form, validation, activity listing, and editing functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires secure, multi-entity data modeling, robust authorization, and both creation and editing flows. The need for validation, UI, and linking activities to groups increases complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Create Group Viewing Interface",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the group viewing interface into API/data fetching, efficient querying, dashboard UI, group detail display, navigation, and state handling.",
      "reasoning": "Primarily frontend-focused but requires efficient backend queries and smooth navigation. Complexity is moderate due to UI state management and navigation logic."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Activity Logging Backend",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the activity logging backend into schema design, backend module/service, API endpoint, validation (user/group/activity), points calculation, log storage, and log retrieval/filtering.",
      "reasoning": "This backend-heavy task involves complex validation, data integrity, points calculation, and efficient querying, all of which require careful design and testing."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Create Activity Logging UI",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the activity logging UI into form component, activity selection, notes input, API integration, feedback handling, UI flow/navigation, and loading states.",
      "reasoning": "Requires a smooth, intuitive UI with robust validation, integration with backend, and good user feedback. Complexity is increased by the need for seamless UX and error handling."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Personal History View",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the personal history view into API/log querying, sorting/pagination, frontend display, filtering options, summary statistics, and state handling.",
      "reasoning": "Combines backend querying and aggregation with frontend display and filtering, requiring careful handling of large data sets and user experience."
    },

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Group Leaderboard",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the leaderboard into backend aggregation, efficient querying, sorted data return, frontend leaderboard UI, ranking indicators, user highlighting, and refresh logic.",
      "reasoning": "Requires efficient aggregation and sorting, as well as a dynamic, visually clear frontend. Complexity is moderate due to real-time data and ranking logic."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 11,
      "taskTitle": "Configure Basic PWA Features",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down PWA setup into manifest creation, service worker implementation, offline fallback, cache strategies, install prompt, testing, and meta tag configuration.",
      "reasoning": "Standard PWA setup tasks are well-documented but require attention to detail for cross-browser compatibility and offline support."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 12,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Navigation and App Shell",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide navigation and app shell into main navigation UI, app shell layout, responsive design, section routing, nested navigation, breadcrumbs, and error boundaries.",
      "reasoning": "Requires cohesive design and routing logic for a consistent UX. Complexity is moderate due to responsive design and error handling."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 13,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Feedback",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down error handling into global error service, notification system, loading indicators, form validation feedback, empty/error states, error boundaries, and retry mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling is cross-cutting and must be robust, covering both backend and frontend, increasing overall complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 14,
      "taskTitle": "Optimize Database Queries and Security",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide optimization into query review, index implementation, security rules, API authorization, aggregation optimization, data denormalization, rate limiting, and scalability review.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the need for deep understanding of Firestore performance, security, and scalability, as well as cross-cutting impact on all data flows."
